<!---All you need to keep people from seeing the directory contents is an index.php or .html file in that folder. Any requests for yoursite.com/images will load index.php, which you'll set to a dummy page.

index.html could be something like: --->

<html><title>Something Went Wrong</title><body>Oh No! Something went wrong, try reloading the page or going back to <a href="/scims">SciMS Home Page</a></body></html>
